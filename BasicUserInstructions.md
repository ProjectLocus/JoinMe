# Basic User Instructions
Hello, and welcome to Join Me. 

Upon opening the app you are greeted with Google Sign In. Feel free to sign in through your Google account, and once you have, you're officially a member. Just a quick note, the app does grab your display name, email, display image and your Google ID for use in the app.

As you make your way to our main screen you'll be greeted with a simple button in the middle. Pressing that button will expand into 5 more buttons, all with their respective purpose. 
* The top button will take you to your user profile where you'll see the details that we grabbed from your Google sign in such as your display name and user image. Future implementations will allow you to create a description. 
* The top right button will send you to a view with a list of people near you. These are actual people are near your respective latitude and longitude according to the grid that we laid out in the backend. More information there if you want to know how that functions. 
* The bottom right button takes you to the create an invitation view where you create an invitation. Some of the fields are already hardcoded in, but feel free to input your own and it'll all be grabbed. Pressing the enter button will save the invitation.
* The bottom left button will show you a list of invitations that you sent, and to who you sent them.
* The top left button will show you a list of invitations you've received. Future implementations will allow you to actually view the invitation with the details, and accept or decline it. Accepting the invitation could allow you to see who all else will be attending the event the invitation was sent to.

Each screen has a log out, feel free to log out at any time. Each also has a Home button to allow the user to get back to the main screen with all the buttons.

Thanks again for checking out our app, and I hope you find it fun and interesting.
